learning-based Attack Detection and Classification for Controller Area Network
Cybersecurity in in-vehicle network, such as controller area network, is vital to the security of vehicle systems and safe-driving of drivers. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of controller area network from the perspective of encryption and authentication. Then, we develop learning-based attack detection models based on the hex data from in-vehicle controller area network. The best attack detection model is selected through comparing models learned by logistic regression, random forest, convolutional neural network, and support vector regression. The simulation based on 26985 samples are performed. The simulation results show that all learning models perform well on predicting 0-1 decision problem with 100% accuracy, while in predicting multiple class decision problem, random forest-based model outperforms other three models with 99.99% accuracy.
